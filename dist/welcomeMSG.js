Hello! What can I help you? 

You can chat with me using the following commands: 
1. Operation Command: To perform mathematical calculations, simply write the expression you want to evaluate. For example, you can write "1+1' or '5*3' to get the corresponding results.
2. History Command: To see the latest calculations, just type "history" and I'll show you the ten most recent calculations.

Example:

User: /operation 1+1
Bot: 2

User:/history
Bot:
1+1=2
22-4`;
